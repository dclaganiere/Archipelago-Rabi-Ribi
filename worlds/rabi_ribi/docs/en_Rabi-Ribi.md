# Rabi-Ribi

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle, the player may need to access certain areas before they
would be expected to in the vanilla game.

This randomizer features an option to additionally add a number of randomly-selected map edits to the game. These community-developed constraints are designed to prevent access to areas early and, depending on your difficulty settings, require the use of glitches to access areas. Additional options can also shuffle Erina's starting location and map entrances.

## What is the goal of Rabi-Ribi in Archipelago

The goal of Rabi-Ribi is to find Easter Eggs shuffled throughout Rabi Rabi Island. Collecting
all of the Easter Eggs unlock a Trophy to collect to finish in the starting room! 

Setting the goal to completing the main story is not currently implemented, as the game is beatable with no items.

## What items and locations can get shuffled?

- All upgrades and abilities
- All badges
- All potions and attack upgrades

## What does another world's item look like in Rabi-Ribi?

Upon pickup, the player name and item can be seen in the text client.
